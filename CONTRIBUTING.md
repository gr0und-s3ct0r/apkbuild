You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the gitlab issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the gitlab issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

apkbuild could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official apkbuild docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/gr0und-s3ct0r/apkbuild/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up apkbuild for local development.

1. Fork the apkbuild repo on gitlab.
2. Clone your fork locally:
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/apkbuild.git
```

4. Create a branch for local development:
```shell
$ git checkout -b bugfix-or-feature-or-doc/name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature-or-doc
```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to Gitlab:
```shell
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

7. Submit a pull request through the gitlab website.

Also you can use a tool like [git-pull-request](https://github.com/jd/git-pull-request) 
(created by [Julien Danjou](https://julien.danjou.info/blog/2017/git-pull-request-command-line-tool)) for simply the job.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Add the
   feature to the list in README.md.
3. The pull request should be mergeable and docker image should be buildable.
